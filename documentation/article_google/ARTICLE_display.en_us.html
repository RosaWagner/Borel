    What typographic factors should be considered when teaching reading and writing simultaneously? Initiated in 2017 at the ANRT (research post-master, Nancy, France), this font project was developed in collaboration with teachers and speech therapists, aiming to question educational typographic conventions and explore non-disruptive solutions.

    The traditional cursive style taught in French primary schools has an high ascender/x-height ratio, arguing against its legibility at the size of practice. This can pose as a challenge for all beginner readers, particularly those with learning disabilities. Thus, <em>Borel<em> aims to harmonise cursive strokes with more common typographic structures that are recognised for enhancing readability. This typeface, named in tribute to Suzanne Borel-Maisonny (a french pioneer in speech therapy), features a robust design with a low contrast and a generous x-height. The letters are intentionally open and clearly differentiated while adhering to the conventions of writing in French schools.

    <em>Borel Display</em> is designed for publishers and creatives working beyond the classroom, especially in contexts like children’s books, toy packaging, or kids’ stores. Its cursive capitals, shorter ascenders, and tighter line spacing create a lively rhythm, while the symmetrical loops make the typeface feel friendlier and more approachable than the traditional version of Borel.

    Due to the specifity of this project, the font only supports a limited set of glyphs allowing to write in Catalan, Danish, English, Finnish, German, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Vietnamese—and by extension, any other languages using the same alphabet.
